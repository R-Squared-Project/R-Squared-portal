## Funding update September 1st
The BitShares UI worker is not funded, and all bounty rewards must be considered paused.

Please [check here](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-ui/issues/3044) for more details and updates.

 ------

Please work off the develop branch and make pull requests to that branch. The master branch will only be updated for new releases.

The Bitshares UI team is supported by this [worker proposal](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2019-02-bitshares-ui). It provides the funds needed to pay for the development team and the community bounties.

If you would like to get involved, we have a [Telegram chatroom](https://t.me/BitSharesDEX) where you can ask questions and get help. You may also join [BitShares on Discord](https://discord.gg/GsjQfAJ)

## Development process

- We encourage everyoe to participate in issue discussion, especially those that has [not yet been qualified as work](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-ui/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) and [the `Need Discussion` issues](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-ui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%5B2%5D+Needs+Discussion%22).
- New issues will be groomed by a project coordinator to set the issue goal and estimated **Quality Hours** of development time.
- After a clarified goal issues will be assigned to the [Active Developent milestone](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-ui/milestone/52).
- All non-assigned issues can be found on the the [Active Developent milestone](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-ui/milestone/52). or [by filtering the issues list](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-ui/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Active+Development%22+no%3Aassignee).
- Assigned issues will be assigned to a milestone, which will indicate the deadline for the issues.
- Milestones are numbered YYMMDD and indicates the expected delivery.
- Bugs are always worked before enhancements
- Developers should work each issue according to a numbered branch corresponding to the issue `git checkout -b 123`
- We pay **bounties** for issues that have been estimated. An estimated issue is prefixed with a number in brackets like this: `[2] An nasty bug`. In this example, the bug is valued at two **Quality Hours** ($125 per hour). If you fix this issue according to these guidelines and your PR is accepted, this will earn you $250 worth of bitCNY. You must have a Bitshares wallet and a Bitshares account to receive payment.
- Non-code contributions such as translations, documentation work and others may be compensated at a lower hourly rate. This will be clearly stated in the relevant issue.

**IMPORTANT NOTES FOR NEW DEVELOPERS**
- To claim an issue, simply leave a comment with your request to work on it.
- Bounty payment is **Quality Hours**, meaning an experienced developer could complete the task within the assigned hours. Inexperienced users may need more time, to learn the coding standards or practices used on the project, but still receive the same pay.
- To make sure no underpayment for development is made, it is important that if an issue would require more **Quality Hours** time, it should be stated clearly in the issue together with a reason and a new estimate, which also requires an approval.
- If an issue is already claimed (assigned), do not attempt to claim it. Issues claimed by outside developers will have no assigned dev, but have the developers name in brackets.
- Do not claim an issue if you will be unable to complete it by the date indicated on the Milestone name. If extra time is expected, clarify why in the claim. The new estimate will have to be confirmed by a project coordinator.
- If an issue misses the intended milestone completion, be sure to make a comment on your progress including the reason for the delay. The issue is pushed to the next milestone. Failing to comment or complete the issue will result in release of the assigned issue and could result in no bounty pay.
- It's the developers responsibility to read comments on submitted PR to make sure merging is possible and issue is closed, failure to do so may result in no bounty pay.
