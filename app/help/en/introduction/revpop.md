## Introduction
Welcome to the worlds fastest decentralized exchange (The DEX).

RevPop looks to extend the innovation of the blockchain to all industries
that rely upon the internet to provide their services. Whether its banking,
stock exchanges, lotteries, voting, music, auctions or many others, a digital
public ledger allows for the creation of distributed autonomous companies (or
DACs) that provide better quality services at a fraction of the cost incurred by
their more traditional, centralized counterparts. The advent of DACs ushers in a
new paradigm in organizational structure in which companies can run without any
human management and under the control of an incorruptible set of business
rules. These rules are encoded in publicly auditable open source software
distributed across the computers of the companiesâ€™ shareholders, who
effortlessly secure the company from arbitrary control.

RevPop does for business what bitcoin did for money by utilizing distributed
consensus technology to create companies that are inherently global,
transparent, trustworthy, efficient and most importantly profitable.

BitShares Blockchain has enabled several financial innovations such as: User Issued Asset (UIA), Market Pegged Asset (MPA), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), Decentralized Exchange (DEX), Automated Market Maker (AMM) and Hashed Time-lock Contract (HTLC).
